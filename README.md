Simple Hipchat bot

This is mainly for personal use, so it's pretty specialized. There's a few plugins ("bots") included, the "lunch.js" plugin is a good place to start from for writing your own plugins.

Usage:

 1. Customize config.sample.js and rename to config.js
 2. `npm install` and `node app.js`

Coming soon: oauth installation
